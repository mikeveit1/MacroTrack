# MacroTrack

A comprehensive iOS nutrition tracking app built with SwiftUI that helps users monitor their daily macronutrient intake and achieve their fitness goals.

## Overview

MacroTrack is a feature-rich nutrition tracking application that combines modern iOS development practices with powerful backend services to provide users with a seamless macro counting experience. The app integrates with the FatSecret API for comprehensive food data and uses Firebase for secure user authentication and data persistence.

## Features

### ðŸ¥— Food Logging
- **Meal-based tracking**: Log foods across breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and water intake
- **Comprehensive food database**: Search through thousands of foods using FatSecret API integration
- **Accurate macro calculations**: Track calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fat with precision
- **Serving size adjustments**: Easily modify portions and see real-time macro updates
- **Date navigation**: View and edit food logs for any date with intuitive swipe gestures

### ðŸ“Š Macro Calculator
- **Personalized calculations**: Uses the Mifflin St. Jeor equation for accurate calorie needs
- **Customizable goals**: Set targets based on weight loss, maintenance, or muscle gain
- **Activity level adjustment**: Accounts for different activity levels (sedentary to super active)
- **Automatic goal setting**: Calculates optimal protein/carb/fat ratios (25/45/30)

### ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking
- **Visual progress indicators**: Color-coded progress bars for each macronutrient
- **Daily goal comparison**: Real-time tracking against personalized targets
- **Customizable display**: Toggle visibility of different macro categories
- **Streak tracking**: Monitor consecutive days of food logging

### ðŸ‘¤ User Profile & Analytics
- **Personal dashboard**: View daily goals and average intake statistics
- **Progress analytics**: Track long-term trends and logging consistency
- **Account management**: Secure authentication with email/password
- **Data backup**: All data synced securely to Firebase

### ðŸ“± Sharing & Export
- **Screenshot sharing**: Share daily goals, individual meals, or complete daily logs
- **Multiple export formats**: Choose specific data to share via iOS share sheet
- **Progress visualization**: Beautiful, shareable summaries of nutrition data

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture
- **Framework**: SwiftUI for modern, declarative UI
- **Platform**: iOS 17.4+ and macOS 14.3+ support
- **Orientation**: Portrait-optimized interface

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: SwiftUI, Combine
- **Backend**: Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Auth, Firebase Storage
